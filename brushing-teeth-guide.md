# How to Brush Your Teeth

## Introduction
Brushing your teeth is an essential practice to maintain oral hygiene, remove food particles, and prevent diseases such as cavities and gum infections. This guide explains the tools required and the step-by-step process of brushing teeth for individuals who may be unfamiliar with the concept.

## What You Need
To brush your teeth, you will require two essential items:

### 1. Toothbrush
A toothbrush is a handheld tool designed to clean teeth. It consists of:
- **Handle**: A long, usually plastic part that allows you to grip and control the brush.
- **Bristles**: A cluster of soft fibers attached to the end of the handle that are used to scrub the surface of teeth.
- **Head**: The part of the toothbrush that holds the bristles and comes in contact with your teeth.

Toothbrushes come in different sizes and bristle strengths, but soft-bristled toothbrushes are generally recommended to prevent damage to the gums.

### 2. Toothpaste
Toothpaste is a cleaning substance used with a toothbrush to enhance the cleaning process. It is a gel or paste that contains:
- **Fluoride**: A mineral that helps strengthen teeth and prevent cavities.
- **Abrasives**: Small particles that help remove plaque and food debris.
- **Flavoring agents**: To provide a fresh taste, such as mint.
- **Detergents**: To create foam, which helps distribute the toothpaste evenly.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Brushing Your Teeth

### Step 1: Prepare Your Toothbrush
- Wet the bristles of your toothbrush with clean water.
- Apply a small amount (pea-sized) of toothpaste onto the bristles.

### Step 2: Start Brushing
- Place the toothbrush at a **45-degree angle** against your gum line.
- Use **gentle, circular motions** to clean the outer surfaces of your teeth.
- Repeat this process for both the upper and lower teeth.

### Step 3: Clean the Inner Surfaces
- Tilt the toothbrush vertically and use **up-and-down strokes** to clean the back of your teeth.

### Step 4: Brush the Chewing Surfaces
- Move the toothbrush back and forth on the top surfaces of your teeth where you chew food.

### Step 5: Clean Your Tongue
- Gently brush your tongue to remove bacteria and freshen your breath.

### Step 6: Rinse
- Spit out the toothpaste and rinse your mouth with clean water.
- Rinse the toothbrush with water and store it in an upright position to air dry.

## Frequency and Additional Tips
- Brush your teeth **twice a day**, preferably in the morning and before bed.
- Replace your toothbrush **every 3â€“4 months** or when the bristles become frayed.
